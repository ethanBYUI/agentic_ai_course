Often used to model structured agent workflows or pipelines.\n\n\nDeliberative Agent\nAn agent that explicitly plans its actions before executing them, rather than reacting immediately.\n\n\nDeterminism\nHow consistent an agent’s outputs are when given the same input. Lower randomness (temperature) leads to more deterministic behavior.\n\n\nELT (Extract, Load, Transform)\nA data workflow where data is collected, stored, and then transformed later. Common in systems where agents need access to raw data.\n\n\nEtLT (Extract, Transform Lightly, Load, Transform)\nA hybrid data approach where minimal cleanup happens before storage, followed by more detailed processing later.\n\n\nEvaluation (Evals)\nMethods used to measure how well an agent performs, including correctness, reliability, cost, latency, and safety.\n\n\nFunction Calling / Tool Calling\nA structured way for an agent to choose and invoke tools (APIs, functions, databases) instead of responding only with text.\n\n\nGrounding\nConnecting an agent’s responses to real, trusted data sources (like databases or documents) to improve accuracy and reduce hallucinations.\n\n\nGuardrails\nRules and constraints that prevent unsafe, unethical, or unwanted agent behavior.\n\n\nHuman-in-the-Loop (HITL)\nWorkflows where a human reviews, approves, or edits an agent’s actions or plans before they are executed.\n\n\nMemory\nInformation an agent can store and reuse.\n- Short-term memory: recent conversation or task context\n- Long-term memory: stored facts, documents, or embeddings\n\n\nMulti-Agent System\nA system where multiple agents work together, often with different roles or responsibilities.\n\n\nObservability\nThe ability to see what an agent is doing internally, including its prompts, tool calls, decisions, and errors.\n\n\nOrchestration\nThe coordination of agent steps, tools, and workflows so tasks happen in the correct order and failures are handled.\n\n\nPerception\nHow an agent receives and interprets inputs such as user messages, documents, API responses, or web data.\n\n\nPlanning\nThe process of breaking a goal into smaller steps before acting.\n\n\nPrompt\nInstructions or input given to a language model.\n- System prompt: high-level rules and behavior\n- User prompt: user input\n- Tool prompt: information returned from tools\n\n\nPrompt Injection\nA security risk where malicious input attempts to override an agent’s instructions or policies.\n\n\nRAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)\nA technique where relevant documents or data are retrieved at runtime and provided to the model before it generates a response.\n\n\nReactive Agent\nAn agent that responds immediately to inputs without long-term planning or reasoning.\n\n\nReflection\nAn agent’s ability to review its own output or mistakes and adjust future behavior.\n\n\nState\nAll information that defines where an agent is in a task, including memory, progress, and tool results.\n\n\nTool\nAn external capability an agent can use, such as an API, database, calculator, or web search.\n\n\nWorkflow\nA structured sequence of steps that an agent follows to complete a task."

The code for this file looks like the following:\n\nGEMINI_API_KEY = 12345 # replace this with your key\n\nLastly, save the .env file.\nYou can now run the below code to install needed packages and load the environment variables from .env into this file\n\n\n\n\nPlease run the following in your terminal in VS Code. If you cannot find the terminal there is a tab on the top of the screen called terminal, select New Terminal and paste the code below into it and press ENTER\npip install -q -U langchain langchain-google-genai python-dotenv\n\n\n\nThis code we need to run inside a notebook. Go into the notebooks folder and create a file called setup.ipynb then create a code chunk and paste in the following code\n\n\nTrue\n\n\nYou will need to rerun load_dotenv() every time you open the file again, but not pip install above, which is a one time run\n\n\n\nNow that everything is set up, lets see if the LLM will respond to us\n\nfrom langchain.chat_models import init_chat_model\n\nmodel = init_chat_model(\n    model=\"gemini-2.5-flash\", \n    model_provider=\"google_genai\"\n)\n\nmodel.invoke(\"Hello world!\")\n\nAIMessage(content='Hello there! Welcome! How can I help you today?', additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={'finish_reason': 'STOP', 'model_name': 'gemini-2.5-flash', 'safety_ratings': [], 'model_provider': 'google_genai'}, id='lc_run--019c0246-d689-7ac1-9a3c-cf91716ba174-0', tool_calls=[], invalid_tool_calls=[], usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 4, 'output_tokens': 42, 'total_tokens': 46, 'input_token_details': {'cache_read': 0}, 'output_token_details': {'reasoning': 30}})\n\n\nIf you got things working, rejoice!\nMake sure to help your neighbor gets there too. Then you can continue."
