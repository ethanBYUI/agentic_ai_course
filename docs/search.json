    "text": "Agentic AI Dictionary\n\nAgent\nA software system that can take in information, reason about what to do, and take actions, often repeatedly, to achieve a goal.\n\n\nAgentic AI\nAn approach to AI where systems are built as agents that plan, use tools, remember information, and act autonomously or semi-autonomously rather than just generating single responses.\n\n\nAPI (Application Programming Interface)\nA set of rules that lets software systems talk to each other, such as an agent calling a weather service, database, or payment system.\n\n\nArchitecture (Agent Architecture)\nThe overall design of how an agent is structured, including how it reasons, stores memory, calls tools, and loops through tasks.\n\n\nDAGs (Directed Acyclic Graphs)\nA way to represent workflows as connected steps with a clear order and no loops. Often used to model structured agent workflows or pipelines.\n\n\nDeliberative Agent\nAn agent that explicitly plans its actions before executing them, rather than reacting immediately.\n\n\nDeterminism\nHow consistent an agent’s outputs are when given the same input. Lower randomness (temperature) leads to more deterministic behavior.\n\n\nELT (Extract, Load, Transform)\nA data workflow where data is collected, stored, and then transformed later. Common in systems where agents need access to raw data.\n\n\nEtLT (Extract, Transform Lightly, Load, Transform)\nA hybrid data approach where minimal cleanup happens before storage, followed by more detailed processing later.\n\n\nEvaluation (Evals)\nMethods used to measure how well an agent performs, including correctness, reliability, cost, latency, and safety.\n\n\nFunction Calling / Tool Calling\nA structured way for an agent to choose and invoke tools (APIs, functions, databases) instead of responding only with text.\n\n\nGrounding\nConnecting an agent’s responses to real, trusted data sources (like databases or documents) to improve accuracy and reduce hallucinations.\n\n\nGuardrails\nRules and constraints that prevent unsafe, unethical, or unwanted agent behavior.\n\n\nHuman-in-the-Loop (HITL)\nWorkflows where a human reviews, approves, or edits an agent’s actions or plans before they are executed.\n\n\nMemory\nInformation an agent can store and reuse.\n- Short-term memory: recent conversation or task context\n- Long-term memory: stored facts, documents, or embeddings\n\n\nMulti-Agent System\nA system where multiple agents work together, often with different roles or responsibilities.\n\n\nObservability\nThe ability to see what an agent is doing internally, including its prompts, tool calls, decisions, and errors.\n\n\nOrchestration\nThe coordination of agent steps, tools, and workflows so tasks happen in the correct order and failures are handled.\n\n\nPerception\nHow an agent receives and interprets inputs such as user messages, documents, API responses, or web data.\n\n\nPlanning\nThe process of breaking a goal into smaller steps before acting.\n\n\nPrompt\nInstructions or input given to a language model.\n- System prompt: high-level rules and behavior\n- User prompt: user input\n- Tool prompt: information returned from tools\n\n\nPrompt Injection\nA security risk where malicious input attempts to override an agent’s instructions or policies.\n\n\nRAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)\nA technique where relevant documents or data are retrieved at runtime and provided to the model before it generates a response.\n\n\nReactive Agent\nAn agent that responds immediately to inputs without long-term planning or reasoning.\n\n\nReflection\nAn agent’s ability to review its own output or mistakes and adjust future behavior.\n\n\nState\nAll information that defines where an agent is in a task, including memory, progress, and tool results.\n\n\nTool\nAn external capability an agent can use, such as an API, database, calculator, or web search.\n\n\nWorkflow\nA structured sequence of steps that an agent follows to complete a task."
