# Course Objectives

- Design, diagram, implement, evaluate, productize, and scale agentic AI systems using modern LLM frameworks and tooling.
- Identify and evaluate problems that are appropriate for agentic AI solutions, and distinguish them from problems better solved by traditional software or non-agentic LLM approaches.
- Clearly define Agentic AI and related concepts, including agents, tools, planning, grounding, orchestration, evaluation, and human-in-the-loop workflows.
- Develop and articulate ethical guidelines for the use of LLMs and agentic AI, including responsible data usage, AI governance principles, safety, privacy, and organizational policy considerations.
- Build the capability to independently learn, evaluate, and adapt to new AI models, tools, and paradigms in a rapidly evolving AI ecosystem.
