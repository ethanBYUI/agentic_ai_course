# Agentic AI Dictionary

### Agent
A software system that can take in information, reason about what to do, and take actions, often repeatedly, to achieve a goal.

### Agentic AI
An approach to AI where systems are built as agents that plan, use tools, remember information, and act autonomously or semi-autonomously rather than just generating single responses.

### API (Application Programming Interface)
A set of rules that lets software systems talk to each other, such as an agent calling a weather service, database, or payment system.

### Architecture (Agent Architecture)
The overall design of how an agent is structured, including how it reasons, stores memory, calls tools, and loops through tasks.

### DAGs (Directed Acyclic Graphs)
A way to represent workflows as connected steps with a clear order and no loops. Often used to model structured agent workflows or pipelines.

### Deliberative Agent
An agent that explicitly plans its actions before executing them, rather than reacting immediately.

### Determinism
How consistent an agent’s outputs are when given the same input. Lower randomness (temperature) leads to more deterministic behavior.

### ELT (Extract, Load, Transform)
A data workflow where data is collected, stored, and then transformed later. Common in systems where agents need access to raw data.

### EtLT (Extract, Transform Lightly, Load, Transform)
A hybrid data approach where minimal cleanup happens before storage, followed by more detailed processing later.

### Evaluation (Evals)
Methods used to measure how well an agent performs, including correctness, reliability, cost, latency, and safety.

### Function Calling / Tool Calling
A structured way for an agent to choose and invoke tools (APIs, functions, databases) instead of responding only with text.

### Grounding
Connecting an agent’s responses to real, trusted data sources (like databases or documents) to improve accuracy and reduce hallucinations.

### Guardrails
Rules and constraints that prevent unsafe, unethical, or unwanted agent behavior.

### Human-in-the-Loop (HITL)
Workflows where a human reviews, approves, or edits an agent’s actions or plans before they are executed.

### Memory
Information an agent can store and reuse.  
- **Short-term memory:** recent conversation or task context  
- **Long-term memory:** stored facts, documents, or embeddings

### Multi-Agent System
A system where multiple agents work together, often with different roles or responsibilities.

### Observability
The ability to see what an agent is doing internally, including its prompts, tool calls, decisions, and errors.

### Orchestration
The coordination of agent steps, tools, and workflows so tasks happen in the correct order and failures are handled.

### Perception
How an agent receives and interprets inputs such as user messages, documents, API responses, or web data.

### Planning
The process of breaking a goal into smaller steps before acting.

### Prompt
Instructions or input given to a language model.  
- **System prompt:** high-level rules and behavior  
- **User prompt:** user input  
- **Tool prompt:** information returned from tools

### Prompt Injection
A security risk where malicious input attempts to override an agent’s instructions or policies.

### RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)
A technique where relevant documents or data are retrieved at runtime and provided to the model before it generates a response.

### Reactive Agent
An agent that responds immediately to inputs without long-term planning or reasoning.

### Reflection
An agent’s ability to review its own output or mistakes and adjust future behavior.

### State
All information that defines where an agent is in a task, including memory, progress, and tool results.

### Tool
An external capability an agent can use, such as an API, database, calculator, or web search.

### Workflow
A structured sequence of steps that an agent follows to complete a task.
